    "# Exercise 6: Clustering - k-means\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement the k-means algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do not start the exercise until you fully understand the submission guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The homework assignments are executed automatically. \n",
    "* Failure to comply with the following instructions will result in a significant penalty. \n",
    "* Appeals regarding your failure to read these instructions will be denied. \n",
    "* Kindly reminder: the homework assignments contribute 50% of the final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read the following instructions carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This Jupyter notebook contains all the step-by-step instructions needed for this exercise.\n",
    "1. Write **efficient**, **vectorized** code whenever possible. Some calculations in this exercise may take several minutes when implemented efficiently, and might take much longer otherwise. Unnecessary loops will result in point deductions.\n",
    "1. You are responsible for the correctness of your code and should add as many tests as you see fit to this jupyter notebook. Tests will not be graded nor checked.\n",
    "1. Complete the required functions in `hw6.py` script only. This exercise is graded automatically, and only the `hw6.py` script is tested.\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), numpy and pandas only. **Do not import anything else.**\n",
    "1. Your code must run without errors. Use at least `numpy` 1.15.4. Any code that cannot run will not be graded.\n",
    "1. Write your own code. Cheating will not be tolerated.\n",
    "1. Submission includes this notebook with the exercise number and your ID as the filename and the `hw6.py` script. For example: `hw6_123456789_987654321.ipynb` and `hw6.py` if you submitted in pairs and `hw6_123456789.ipynb` and `hw6.py` if you submitted the exercise alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Color image quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "Color image quantization is the process of transforming an image so that it can be represented with a small subset of colors; a subset smaller than the image's original palette size. Image quantization is a form of lossy data compression since the number of bits used for the palette is reduced. During this compression some data is lost and therefore we must use a careful algorithm that will minimize the perceived difference between the original image and its quantized counterpart. Other than compression, image quantization plays an important role in image recognition algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "When representing images in true color, each pixel is represented by 3 RGB components and each one of the 3 RGB components is represented by 8 bits and can take a value from 0 to 255. This means that in true color representation one can use 2^24≈16 Million different colors. In this exercise we will perform image quantization from images given in true color into 256, 16 or even less colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithms for quantization. In this exercise, you are going to use K-means in color space to achieve quantization. The color (a point in RGB space) assigned to each pixel is the color of the centroid of the cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, every pixel in the image is a point in the three dimensional RGB space. We want to cluster these points into k clusters and then replace each pixel by the centroid of the cluster to which it was assigned to obtain the compressed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might need to install skimage using `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-image`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that `numpy.power()` is a slow function! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25254541/why-is-numpy-power-60x-slower-than-in-lining"
